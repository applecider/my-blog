# Forever A Truly Beautiful Ballet

Swan Lake has always been my favorite ballet. I first watched it in Shenzhen, China a couple years ago. Although I was new to Ballet and didn’t quite appreciate all the movements or the music, I clearly remembered how incredible ballet could be.

Swan Lake is a tragic love story performed in a soft and touching way. I was glad to have had the chance to watch it again in New York last Saturday. It was performed by the New York City Ballet and it's only running for two weeks, from late September to early October. They didn’t perform it last year either. Maybe it’s just too beautiful, too much pressure to bring it to the audience. After all, it's one of the most classic ballet known to the world.

The David H. Koch theater itself is a truly beauty as well. Originally designed by architect Philip Johnson in 1964, it was renovated with $100 million commitment by David H. Koch in 2008. It's an old fashion classic with new state-of-art technology. This production has already succeeded by performing in this theater.

Swan Lake is based on a tragic love story. Princess Odette was turned into swan by the devil Von Rotbart. She could only change back if Price Siegfried is able to keep his promise to love her and choose her as his queen. The devil, however, tricked Prince Siegfried by making him fall in love with Odile, his daughter. True love couldn’t defeat destiny. The heartbroken Odette eventually leaves with her fellow swans never to return.

Odette and Odile are played by the same dancer. It’s quite an challenge for an dancer to be both Odette/Odile at the same show. She has to be both innocent and evil. As Odette, she danced to pray for love and rescue. Then as Odile, her dance was seductive and chaotic. She’s a masterpiece of woman whose full of mysteries that men could never understand.  Price Siegfried was entranced and fall in love with both of them. He made promises to both of them: to love, be loyal, and name both of them his queen. As payment for his infedelity and betrayal, Prince Siegfried lost Odette forever.

I was thinking about the love story while I was watching the performance. The feeling of the sorrow stayed with me from the moment the music started.
